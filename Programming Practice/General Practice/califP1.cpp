/*
Write a program to compute the volume of the intersection of a set of cubes.
The input will consist of several sets of cubes in free format. Each set begins with
a positive integer, which indicates the number of cube descriptions that follow. Each
description consists of four integers, x, y, z, and s, indicating the coordinates of a corner
of the cube and the distance (s > 0) that the three edges of the cube extend from that
corner in the positive direction.
For each set of cubes, output one line containing the volume of their intersection.
